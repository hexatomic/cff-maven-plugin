# Citation File Format Maven plugin

This is a helper plugin to create a [CFF](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) file for
a Maven project.

## Goals

### cff:create

```
mvn cff:create
```

Create Citation File Format with references from the dependencies defined via Maven.
The third-party references will be generated by multiple sources, e.g. the Maven metadata
or OSGI manifest entries. 
For artifacts, which are located in a P2 repository and mapped to Maven by Eclipse Tycho, heuristics can
be applied to find a corresponding Maven Central artifact or query the [Clearly Defined REST API](clearlydefined.io) if the artifact is known in their curated database.

| `output`                   | `${basedir}/CITATION.cff` | The output file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `thirdPartyFolder`         | `${basedir}/THIRD-PARTY`  | If available, third-party license files like `NOTICE` or `about.html` are added to a subfolder of this folder                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `input`                    | \<empty\>                 | A CFF input file that will be extended. E.g. if you want to add additional information to the CFF file that is not automatically generated, you can write this information into the input file and and the plugin will extend the input file with new information, but will not override existing existing entries. |
| `skipExistingDependencies` | `true`                    | If `true`, don't replace existing reference entries from the input file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `includeEMail`             | `true`                    | If `true`, include the e-mail information from the Maven metadata into author information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
